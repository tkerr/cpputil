aunit - Arduino unit test helper functions

A set of functions used to facilitate unit testing on an Arduino.

Designed to be lightweight due to the limited resources of some
Arduino platforms.  This is not a complete unit test framework.

Copy aunit.cpp and aunit.h into your unit test sketch folder and
compile them along with your unit test sketch.
